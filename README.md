# Sampling Designs

This is an experimental code to simulate iterations of the Jacobson-Matthews Markov chain for sampling Latin squares uniformly, and supports as well a variation of this algorithm focused on sampling graph 1-factorizations.

## Compilation and execution

To execute this code it is required to have a C++17 (or higher) compiler. In particular, we use `g++`.

### Linux and MacOS
Once you have `g++` installed in your system, simply run 
`./run.sh`. 

### Windows
Once you have `g++` installed in your system, run `g++ -O2 main.cc -o main.exe`. Then, run `main.exe`.
